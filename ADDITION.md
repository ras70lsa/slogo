###Estimation:
About 1 hour to implement. Was thinking about adding two classes - one for creating the titled pane with a list view and another for creating the cell factory for the list view.

###Review:
About 30-45 minutes. Added/modified three classes - turtleImageDisplay, which is responsible for displaying the listview, imageCellFactory, which is the cell factory class, imageFileOrganizer which provides the functionality for user to select new image. 

###Analysis:
I think we have a very good infrastructure in place for adding additional views. If I were not familiar with the code, I would have known where to add the listview, which class I should extend from, etc. I think the packaging name could be improved to reflect the structure/hierarchy.
