All indexing starts at 0

## Needed information

* To toggle whether or not a turtle is active, click the turtle image on the screen.
* Entire workspaces can be saved during the running of the application through the file bar
* User-defined commands can be saved and loaded as XMLs externally (meaning they can be accessed after the application has be stopped and re-launched)

##Features 

* Debugging 
* Recursion
* Dynamic Scope (variables can be used during running and scope is visually shown - use the debugger to see this) 
* Save entire workspaces
* Save user-defined command scripts as XMLs
