Estimation: before looking at the old code:
how long do you think it will take you to complete this new feature? 3-4 hours
how many files will you need to add or update? Why? ~8 , one for each new language element (3), one to update the main recursive class to be aware of these new language elements (1), one to update the property files of the language to key conversions (1), one new class for each new draw mode in the model class (3)
Review: after completing the feature:
how long did it take you to complete this new feature?
how many files did you need to add or update? Why?
did you get it completely right on the first try?
